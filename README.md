# Youtube Data Collection and Analysis

## Purpose and objectives
The YouTube Data Collection and Analysis Project aims to gather and analyze trending YouTube video data to uncover insights into viewer engagement, content popularity, and trends. By leveraging YouTube's API, the project collects detailed metadata, engagement metrics, and other relevant information about trending videos. The primary objectives are to:
* Collect comprehensive data on trending YouTube videos.
* Analyze the data to identify patterns and trends in viewer engagement.
* Provide actionable insights for content creators, marketers, and researchers.
## Motivation and Applications
The motivation behind this project is to understand the dynamics of YouTube content consumption and engagement. Potential applications and benefits include:
* Helping content creators optimize their videos for better engagement.
* Assisting marketers in identifying popular content trends.
* Providing researchers with data for studying online video consumption behavior.
## Data Collection
## Method and tools
The data collection process involves using the YouTube Data API to fetch information about trending videos. The key steps include:
* API Calls: Utilizing the YouTube data api v3 from google console to interact with the YouTube Data API.
* Data Storage: Storing the collected data in a pandas DataFrame and saving it as a CSV file for further analysis.
## Types of Data Collected
The project collects various types of data, including:
* Video Metadata: Video ID, title, description, published date, channel information, category ID, and tags.
* Engagement Metrics: View count, like count, dislike count, favorite count, and comment count.
* Content Details: Duration, definition, and caption availability.
These data points were selected to provide a comprehensive view of each video's performance and characteristics.
## Challenges and Limitations
* API Rate Limits: Managing the rate limits imposed by the YouTube API.
* Pagination: Handling pagination to collect more than the default number of results.
* Data Completeness: Ensuring all relevant data points are collected for each video.
These challenges were addressed by implementing efficient API call handling and data validation techniques.
## Data Analysis
## Techniques and Tools
The data analysis process involves using various techniques and tools to extract insights from the collected data:
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
* isodate: For parsing video duration in ISO 8601 format.
## Specific Analyses Performed
The project performs several analyses, including:
* Trend Analysis: Identifying patterns in video engagement metrics over time.
* Engagement Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between video length and engagement metrics (views, likes, comments).
* Content Categorization: Categorizing videos based on their duration and analyzing engagement within each category.
## Key Findings
Some key findings from the data analysis include:
* Short videos (0-5 mins) dominate in likes, views, and comments.
* Engagement generally decreases as video length increases, with some exceptions.
* There is a very weak relationship between the number of tags and views.
* Most videos are published between 2 PM and 8 PM, indicating this may be an optimal time for uploading videos.
